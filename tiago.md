Born in Luxembourg from Belgian and Portuguese parents, I moved to Brussels at the age of 6.

I was a computer geek during my teens, and discovered programming with the BASIC language. Later tried various Assembler languages, Pascal, C, C++, and other more obscure ones during my studies. After a brief game developer career, I moved to web development with PHP, and then Ruby.

I work at Spreds, a small company that organizes private funding between local entrepreneurs and investors, doing web development with the Ruby on Rails framework.

In addition to HYF, I also try to help with the RubyBelgium organization and the Rails Girls Brussels events.
